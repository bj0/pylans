I am trying to make pylans as easy as possible to use.  To this end I have tried to use some of the most popular binary packing options for windows.  I haven't tested much on linux, as it's much easier to get the dependencies, but pyinstaller and cxfreeze are supposed to support linux.

The ideal solution would have the following:
 * Be buildable from linux (wine OK)
 * Easy to setup build enviroment
 * Produce simple, easy to use stand-alone application
   * In the future I might make an installer, but for the time being it is more convinient to simply have a stand alone app that can be moved around and launched from anywhere
   * This boils down to whether libraries can be packaged into a single .exe/.zip file or subdirectory

Enviroment Dependencies:
 * Python - 
   * Python.org - stock python distribution, has windows installers.  pip can be used to install pure-python dependencies, but binary dependencies must or deps with extension modules that require compilation must be installed with a pre-built windows installer or binary egg
   * ActivePython  - A bundled distribution of python.  ActivePython makes it easy to setup an enviroment because it comes with PyPM, a binary package manager that allows all dependencies to be installed from the command line

  * Twisted - contains extension modules that require compilation, installers can be found at website
    * zope.interface - required by twisted, can be installed using pip

  * pycryptopp - extension module.  current release not available as binary, older version can be found as binary egg at: https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/deps/tahoe-dep-eggs/

  * ipython (optional) - installer available at website (requires compilation i think)
    * pyreadline - optional requirement of ipython, can be installed with pip


Tried so far:

PyInstaller 1.5.1: 
 * not installed, scripts run from source directory (Configure.py, Makespec.py, Build.py)
 * pyinstaller is incompatible with ActivePython!
 * can produce a single-file executable (it extracts itself to a tempdir and executes from there, then deletes it later)
 * can also produce a single directory, but it contains all files (no structure) which is cluttered and annoying to try and find the .exe in
 * supports linux
 * works under wine - it works under wine if wine's system dlls are excluded, otherwise it produces errors while on a real windows system (still runs ok on one)
   * i had to modify the .spec file to remove binary libraries

wine python /home/bjp/code/oss/pyinstaller-1.5.1/Build.py *onefile.spec
wine python /home/bjp/code/oss/pyinstaller-1.5.1/Build.py *onedir.spec
single file ~ 8.0M
directory ~ 15M


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Py2Exe: (not tested recently)
 * Requires Windows Installer - on website
 * does not work under wine - supposedly it produces binaries that can be fixed with some other program, never looked into it
 * can produce single executable file, .exe + .zip, or .exe + subdirectory.  good options
 * does not support linux

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
cx_Freeze: 4.2.3  
SIZE: ~ 7.2M
 * Requires Windows Installer - on website
 * only produces a directory full of files.
 * targetDir doesn't copy all files to output dir, so it fails to run unless copied manually
 * works with wine
 * supports linux?


wine python cxfsetup.py build
~ 7.2M
 - ctrl+d doesn't to work

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
bbfreeze:
 * Requires Windows Installer - on PyPI site
 * requires modulegraph, altgraph, pefile - all installable by pip
 * works from wine
 * produces directory of files

wine python bbsetup.py
~13M

setting up build env:
install wine
 apt-get install wine1.3

create wineprefix
 mkdir ~/winepy

set WINEPREFIX
 export WINEPREFIX=~/winepy
install python
 wine msiexec /i python-2.7.2.msi

install pywin32
 wine pywin32-217.win32-py2.7.exe

install cxFreeze
 wine msiexec /i cx_Freeze-4.2.3.win32-py2.7.msi

install bbfreeze
 wine bbfreeze-1.0.0.win32-py2.7.exe

install setuptools (for easy_install)
 wine setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe

add "C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts" to path
 * for wine, that means adding a Path variable to the registry with regedit, at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
   * should have Path = c:\windows;c:\windows\system;c:\python27;c:\python27\scripts

 * can use saved .reg file:
   wine regedit python_path.reg

install pip
 wine easy_install pip

install pyreadline
 wine pip install pyreadline

install zope.interface
 wine pip install zope.interface

install twisted
 wine Twisted-12.0.0.win32-py2.7.exe

install ipython (optional)
 wine pip install ipython

install pycryptopp binary egg
 wine easy_install https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/deps/tahoe-dep-eggs/pycryptopp-0.5.29-py2.7-win32.egg

fix zope.interface
 * create zope/__init__.py
